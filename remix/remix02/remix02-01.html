    <p id="content">
      <span class="convert">On 11 and 12 January 2020, WHO received further detailed information from the National
        Health Commission about the </span><span class="perserve shake-little">outbreak</span><span class="convert">. WHO is
        reassured of the quality of the ongoing investigations and the response measures implemented in Wuhan, and the
        commitment to share information regularly. The evidence is highly suggestive that the </span><span
        class="perserve shake-little">outbreak</span><span class="convert"> is associated with exposures in one seafood market in
        Wuhan. The market was closed on 1 January 2020. At this stage</span><span class="convert">, there is no
        infection among healthcare workers, and</span><span class="perserve shake-little">no clear evidence of human to human
        transmission</span><span class="convert">. The Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance
        and follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations. Among the 41 confirmed cases, there
        has been one death. This death occurred in a patient with serious underlying medical conditions. China shared
        the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus on 12 January, which will be of great importance for other
        countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits. The cluster was initially reported on 31 December 2019,
        when the WHO China Country Office was informed. The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus
        (novel coronavirus, nCoV), which was isolated on 7 January 2020. Laboratory testing was conducted on all
        suspected cases identified through active case finding and retrospective review. Other respiratory pathogens
        such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle
        East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were ruled out as the cause. According to information conveyed
        to WHO by Chinese authorities on 11 and 12 January, 41 cases with novel coronavirus infection have been
        preliminarily diagnosed in Wuhan City. Of the 41 cases reported, seven are severely ill. This is when the one
        death, mentioned above, was reported, in a patient with other underlying health conditions. Six patients have
        been discharged from hospital. Symptom onset of the 41 confirmed nCoV cases ranges from 8 December 2019 to 2
        January 2020. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020. The clinical signs and symptoms
        reported are mainly</span><span class="perserve shake-little">fever</span><span class="convert">, with a few cases
        having</span><span class="perserve shake-little">difficulty in breathing</span><span class="convert">, and chest radiographs
        showing</span><span class="perserve shake-little">invasive pneumonic infiltrates</span><span class="convert"> in both lungs.
        National authorities report that patients have been isolated and are receiving treatment in Wuhan medical
        institutions. According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers
        and frequent visitors to the </span><span class="perserve shake-little">Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market</span><span
        class="convert">. The government reports that there is </span><span class="perserve shake-little">no clear
        evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person</span><span class="convert">. Currently, no
        case with infection of this novel coronavirus has been reported elsewhere other than Wuhan. Public Health
        Response China's National Health Commission has deployed a group of experts to Wuhan City to support the local
        response. National authorities have reported the following response measures: A total of 763 close contacts
        including healthcare workers, have been identified and followed up and </span><span class="perserve shake-little">no
        additional cases of infection</span><span class="convert"> with the novel coronavirus have been
        identified; The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective
        investigations of the current cluster of patients have been completed The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has
        been temporarily closed to carry out environmental </span><span class="perserve shake-little">sanitation and
        disinfection</span><span class="convert"> ; Public risk communication activities have been carried out to
        improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and
        is in regular contact with national authorities in China to provide support required. Technical guidance on
        novel coronavirus has been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information is available. WHO
        risk assessment To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the </span><span
        class="perserve shake-little">outbreak</span><span class="convert">. Wuhan city is a major domestic and international
        transport hub. To date, there have been </span><span class="perserve shake-little">no reported cases outside of Wuhan
        City</span><span class="convert">. More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required
        to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection;
        as well as the countermeasures implemented. WHO advice Based on information provided by national authorities,
        WHOâ€™s recommendations on public health measures and surveillance for novel coronaviruses apply. WHO does not
        recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness
        either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with
        their healthcare provider. Travel guidance has been updated. WHO advises against the application of any travel
        or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event.</span>
